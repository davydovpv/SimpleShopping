This is a basic react-native application that demonstrates basic SignIn
and SignUp forms and navigation between them. It also demonstrates basic
react-native components including View, Text, TextInput, Navigator, and Button.

The course used to make this utilized Parse as a backend for user management.
Unfortunately that service is no longer running, however the whole project
has been opensourced (see www.parse.io). There is a good tutorial that was
in the course Q & A that walks through getting set-up with Parse on Heroku -
http://www.alekseev.ca/blog/using-a-parse-server-with-react-native/  Because
Parse wasn't up and running I decided to leave authentication out for now
and to instead focus on the other concepts (I figure it won't be too hard
to add this later).
